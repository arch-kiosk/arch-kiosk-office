## Kiosk Code of Conduct
The Kiosk team and community is made up of a mixture of professionals and volunteers from all over the world, working on every aspect of the project - including development, field research, and teaching.

Diversity is a strength, but it can also lead to communication issues and unhappiness. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to. This code applies equally to founders, contributors, users, and those seeking help and guidance.

This isn’t an exhaustive list of things that you can’t do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it’s intended - a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the technical, research, and pedagogical communities in which we participate.

This code of conduct applies to all spaces directly managed by the Arch-Kiosk project. In addition, violations of this code outside these spaces may affect a person's ability to participate within them.

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report it by emailing laurel_bestock@brown.edu. For more details, please see our reporting guidelines.

-	Be friendly and patient.  
-	Be welcoming. We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.  
-	Be considerate. Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions. Remember that we are an international community, so you might not be communicating in someone else's primary language.  
-	Be respectful. Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.   
-	Be careful in the words that you choose. We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:  
    -	Violent threats or language directed against another person.
    -	Discriminatory jokes and language.
    -	Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
    -	Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
    -	Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
    -	Unwelcome sexual attention.
    -	Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
    -	Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.
    -	When we disagree, try to understand why. Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and Kiosk is no exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.
