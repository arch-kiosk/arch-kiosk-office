ðŸ«¶ Take your time and write reader oriented. Imagine this request to appear in a sea of issues and you don't want the recipient to have to open it to know what it is about. So titles like "I want a feature" really don't help ðŸ¤¨. 
ðŸ˜®Write so that a reader in 4 weeks or 4 months would easily understand what this is about. This is particularly important for feature requests as they are usually not attended to right away.

**Describe your idea or request**
A clear and concise description of what you want to achieve? 
Where do you want it? 

**Screenshots and files**
Draw a sketch, make a screenshot, everything that helps illustrate your feature request if necessary. 

- add a label for either Kiosk or FileMaker recording if you can
