ðŸ«¶ Take your time and write reader oriented. Imagine this issue to appear in a sea of issues and you don't want the recipient to have to open it to know what it is about. So titles like "bug in recording" really don't help ðŸ¤¨. 
ðŸ˜®Write so that a reader in 4 weeks or 4 months would easily understand what this is about. 

**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is. What went wrong? What did you expect to be right?
Where did it happen? Which module, which part of the application?

**To Reproduce (for strange and slippery bugs) **
- can you reproduce it? 
- if so, state the steps as clearly as possible

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

**for strange issues this can be useful**
 - OS and Version
 - device (iPad / laptop)
 - Browser
 - version of the software in which this happened (Kiosk or FileMaker)

- add a label for either Kiosk or FileMaker recording
